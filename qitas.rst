Philosophy
----------

PlatformIO's unique philosophy in the embedded market provides developers with a modern
integrated development environment (:ref:`ide`) that works cross-platform,
supports many different software development kits (SDKs) or :ref:`frameworks`, and
includes sophisticated debugging (:ref:`piodebug`), unit testing (:ref:`unit_testing`),
automated code analysis (:ref:`start`), and remote management (:ref:`pioremote`).
It is architected to maximize flexibility and choice by developers, who can use either
graphical or command line editors (:ref:`piocore`), or both.
